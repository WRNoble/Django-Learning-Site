# django-learning-site
This project was done in accordance with Team Treehouse. The app is a basic mock educational site. The website has a homepage that welcomes you and provides some instructions, followed by various classes which once clicked on reveals more information about the class.

## Getting Started

The user will need access to https://djangolearningromesite.herokuapp.com/ as the deployed site lives at Heroku.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I had was actually working with outdated material. The information I had on deployment was no longer accurate which meant my site would not deploy correctly.

## Solution

After too many hours of web searching I found a tutorial on youtube about deploy django to heroku and while watching that I realized I had a typo in my Procfile.

## Languages

This website is written in Python through the Django framework. In addition to that it also uses CSS and some limited HTML.
